# Calculator-App-Project(Backend)

This project is basically a backend implementation of a calculator.I used python modules for most operations to at least reduce execution overhead since pure python code isn't faster in terms of computations.Most modules that i used eg math,sympy scipy are coded in c/c++ which are compiled languages thus faster execution.
